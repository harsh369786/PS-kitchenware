If no product description has been provided, propose some appropriate features/context based on an analysis of the product image.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light grey (#f0f0f0) to provide a clean, product-focused backdrop, consistent with the original design.
- Primary color: Muted green (#1e4d2b), taken directly from the prompt. The prompt requests exactly this color.
- Accent color: Light grey (#cccccc) used for secondary text and borders. Chosen for its subtle contrast with the background, for a minimalistic look.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern look as requested, for both headings and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, line-style icons for the cart and other interactive elements to maintain a minimalist aesthetic.
- Ensure a responsive layout that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, maintaining consistent spacing and alignment across all screen sizes.
- Apply subtle transitions and hover effects to product images and buttons, using fade-ins and zoom-ins, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
